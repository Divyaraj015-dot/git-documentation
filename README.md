## üîß Git Configuration ##
 **git config --global user.name "Your Name"**  
   Sets your Git username globally().

 **git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"**  
   Sets your Git email globally for all repositories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Setup ##
 **git init**
 Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.


**git clone <repository-url>**
  Clones a remote repository to your local machine.


**git remote add origin <repository-url>**
  Connects your local repository to a remote GitHub repository.


14. **git branch branch-name**  
  Creates a new branch.

15. **git checkout branch-name**  
  Switches to the specified branch.

16. **git merge branch-name**  
  Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

17. **git diff branch-name**  
    To compare commits,branches,files & more.

19. **git branch -d branch-name**  
  Deletes the specified local branch.
# Branches concepts #
- A Git branch is indeed like a parallel version of your project, allowing you to work on features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- Git branches serve as isolated workspaces where you can experiment, develop new features, or fix bugs without impacting the main codebase.
- This isolation allows for safer development practices and more organized workflows.
## Parent Branch ##
- A parent branch in Git refers to the branch from which another branch is created.
- It serves as the starting point or base for the new branch.
- The parent branch is typically the branch you are currently on when creating a new branch.
- In many workflows, the parent branch is considered the "base" branch.
- Understanding the parent branch helps in managing merges and resolving conflicts.
## Child Branch ##
- A child branch in Git is a branch that is created from another branch (the parent branch). 
- It represents a diverging line of development.
- The child branch inherits the commit history of the parent branch up to the point of creation.
- Developing in a child branch allows for isolated work without affecting the parent branch.
- Eventually, changes from the child branch can be merged back into the parent branch.
git init


## üìÑ Staging and Committing ##
**git status**
 Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.



**git add <filename>**
 Stages a specific file for the next commit.


**git add .**
 Stages all modified and new files.


**git commit -m "your message"** 
 Commits the staged changes with a message.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Pushing and Pulling ##
**git push -u origin main**
 Pushes your code to the remote main branch and sets upstream tracking.


**git push** 
 Pushes the committed changes to the remote branch.


**git pull origin main**
 Pulls the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository.

## üåøBranch Management ##
**git branch**
 Lists all local branches in the repository.


**git branch <branch-name>**
 Creates a new branch.


**git checkout <branch-name>** 
 Switches to the specified branch.


**git merge <branch-name>**
 Merges the specified branch into the current branch.


**git diff <branch-name>**
 Compares differences between branches, commits, or files.


**git branch -d <branch-name>**
 Deletes the specified local branch.

## üå± Git Branching Concepts ##
üîπ What is a Branch?
A Git branch is a parallel version of your project. It allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main codebase. Branches provide a safe and organized workflow for both individuals and teams.

üîπ Parent Branch.
A parent branch is the original branch from which a new branch is created.

It acts as the base or starting point.

Typically, the main or develop branch serves as the parent.

Understanding parent branches helps prevent conflicts and improves collaboration.

üîπ Child Branch
A child branch is derived from another branch (the parent).

It contains all commit history from the parent up to the point of creation.

Useful for isolated development of new features or fixes.

Changes from the child branch can be merged back into the parent branch when ready.
